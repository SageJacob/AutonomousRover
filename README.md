# ADIONA - AUTONOMOUS ROVER

## Overview

Our project involves the creation of an autonomous rover that will be ejected from a rocket built by UCF students in various Senior Design groups. 

UCF seniors spend two semesters working with their peers and advisors to create many different types of projects. Some of these projects are multi-disciplinary, including ours. Our project includes one mechanical engineering student, one computer engineering student, and four computer science students. These fields of study are all necessary for our the design, build, and programming of our project
